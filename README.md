# Result-Summary-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description
This project aims to showcase my background skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework. The project includes one 'Container-fluid,' and a 'grid container' is nested within it.

Within the grid container, two grid system columns are embedded, each with a width of 50% from large screens up to extra-extra-large (col-lg-6). Both columns are spanned to 6 columns from large up to extra-extra-large (col-lg-6). Both columns have a z-index behavior with a relative position.

The first column has a z-index order of 2, containing a card with result scores and motivation. It has a 'Primary-background' with a background-opacity of 100. A div flex container was used for alignment within specific parts of the container.

The second column has a z-index order of 1, and it contains a card with a summary of the results. The card has a default 'background-light.'

The font-family, font-size, and font-weight used across the project are 'Hanken Grotesk,' sans-serif, with values of 16px, 18px, 800, 600, and 500, respectively. Some attributes, such as background-color and font-color, are not documented in Bootstrap. Nevertheless, I utilized Bootstrap's documentation to control them.
